      <h1>Welcome to Olivia Shen's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I'm a computer science student at UC Davis with an interest in CS education. 
        I love making art, walking outside, and having quality conversations with people.
        I want to build products that encourage and bring people joy when times seem dark.
        I also want to bring gender diversity to CS by teaching and mentoring younger students.</p>
